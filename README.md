## Grade Expectations

UPDATE - Grade Acheived was exceeds expectations

## Customizations

CSS:

    - Changed to body background color
    - Changed the modal background color

JS Search:

    - Added keyup search function to be able to filter through employees
    - With this the way the employees are filtered is by changing the background color
    of their employee card to crimson, and when deleting the keys out of input field 
    this changes it back to the normal color

API:

    - I added a template literal so that you can request 12, 30, or even up to the 5000 max of the API request
    in the string for the API call. I plan to come back to this project and incoroporate the second project and 
    add page filtering to it.
